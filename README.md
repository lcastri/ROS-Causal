This repository contains the scripts for processing and visualising our dataset named "Human-Robot Spatial Interaction Dataset for Causal Analysis from Mobile Platforms".
The dataset captures a Human-Robot Spatial Interaction (HRSI) scenario between a person and the TIAGo robot. It includes: 
* rosbags containing: Velodyne LiDAR point clound, robot and human state (position, orientation and velocities);
* CSV files containing trajectories of the person and the robot generated by post-processing the rosbags;
* the map of the environment extracted from the TIAGo robot.

The dataset is available on Zenodo at this [link](https://zenodo.org/records/10844902)
